Imagine turning "I love you" from your grandmother into a beautiful piece of wall art. Then, anytime you want to hear her voice, you simply scan the QR code.

That's the magic of sound wave art—and it's easier to create than you think.

## What is Sound Wave Art?

Sound wave art transforms audio recordings into visual artwork. The audio's waveform is displayed as a beautiful, customizable design that can be:

- Printed and framed as wall art
- Given as meaningful gifts
- Used to preserve precious moments
- Scanned with a QR code to play the original audio

## Why Create Sound Wave Art?
