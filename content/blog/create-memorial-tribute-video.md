Creating a memorial tribute video is one of the most meaningful ways to honor a loved one's memory. Whether for a funeral service, celebration of life, or personal keepsake, a well-crafted video can capture a lifetime of memories.

This guide will walk you through creating a memorial video, even if you've never edited video before.

## What is a Memorial Tribute Video?

A memorial tribute video is a collection of photos and videos set to music that tells the story of someone's life. They typically include:

- Photos spanning the person's lifetime
- Video clips (if available)
- Meaningful music
- Captions with dates, locations, or quotes
- Opening and closing titles

## Planning Your Memorial Video

### 1. Gather Photos and Videos

**How many photos do you need?**
- 3-minute video: 20-25 photos
- 5-minute video: 35-40 photos
- 10-minute video: 70-80 photos

**Photo selection tips:**
- Include every life stage (childhood, young adult, family, later years)
- Mix portraits and candid shots
- Include important people and moments
- Choose high-quality images when possible
- Ask family members to contribute photos

**Video clips:**
- Keep clips short (5-10 seconds each)
- Choose clips with clear audio of their voice
- Include moments that show their personality

### 2. Choose the Right Music

Music sets the emotional tone. Here are guidelines:

**Length**: Match song length to video length (3-5 minutes is ideal)

**Style options:**
- **Religious**: "Amazing Grace," "How Great Thou Art"
- **Classical**: "Canon in D," "Ave Maria"
- **Contemporary**: "Somewhere Over the Rainbow," "What a Wonderful World"
- **Personal**: Their favorite song

**Pro tip**: Use two songs - upbeat for younger years, slower for later life.

### 3. Plan Your Story Arc

Structure your video like a story:

**Opening (0-30 seconds)**
- Title card with name and dates
- First photo (baby or young child)

**Early Life (30 seconds - 2 minutes)**
- Childhood and school photos
- Family and siblings
- Early achievements

**Adult Life (2-4 minutes)**
- Career highlights
- Marriage/partnership
- Children and grandchildren
- Hobbies and passions

**Later Years (4-5 minutes)**
- Recent photos
- With family
- Doing things they loved

**Closing (last 15 seconds)**
- Final favorite photo
- Ending message ("Forever in our hearts")
- Dates and name
