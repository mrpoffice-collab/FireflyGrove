- ✅ Users in different Groves cannot see each other's shares
- ✅ Only collection owner can toggle sharing
- ✅ Sharing can be revoked anytime

### Permission Model
- Own collections: Full control (edit, delete, share)

## 📈 Expected Impact

### User Benefits
1. **Easier onboarding** - Family members can share helpful prompts
2. **Better collaboration** - Grove members inspire each other
3. **Richer memories** - More diverse prompt ideas
4. **Time savings** - No need to recreate existing collections

### Business Benefits

2. **Network effects** - Shared collections add value
3. **Family bonding** - Encourages collaboration
4. **User retention** - More reasons to stay active

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current Constraints
1. Can only share with entire Grove (not specific users)
2. No notifications when collections are shared
3. No usage analytics for shared prompts
4. Cannot fork/duplicate shared collections
5. No search/filter for shared collections

### Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

## 🆘 Rollback Procedures

### If Critical Issues Arise

**1. Rollback Code (Vercel)**
```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard:
# Deployments → Find previous deployment → Promote to Production
```

**2. Rollback Database (If Absolutely Necessary)**
```sql
-- Only use if feature causes database issues
ALTER TABLE "SparkCollection" DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "isSharedWithGrove";
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS "SparkCollection_isSharedWithGrove_idx";
```

**3. Disable Feature (Soft Rollback)**
- Feature is opt-in (requires toggling Share on)
- Users who don't use it won't be affected
- Can announce "feature in beta" if issues arise
