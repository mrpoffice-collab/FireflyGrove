## üöÄ What's Ready Now

### ‚úÖ Working Features
1. **Pinterest API Connection** - Token verified and working
2. **Board ID Configured** - Using "Firefly Grove" board
3. **Image Selection System** - Smart matching based on keywords
4. **Screenshot Repository** - Structure ready at `public/marketing/screenshots/`
5. **Auto-Publishing Flow** - Cron job will post with images
6. **Bulk Image Assignment** - API endpoint ready

### üìù Next Steps

#### 1. Test the Connection (2 minutes)
Run this command to test posting a pin:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/pinterest/pin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"memoryId": "your_memory_id", "boardId": "779896929161731641"}'
```

Or use the Pinterest admin dashboard in your app.

#### 2. Add Screenshots (15 minutes)
1. Take screenshots of your site features
2. Save to `public/marketing/screenshots/features/`
3. Update `public/marketing/screenshots/metadata.json`
4. Deploy images to production

Example metadata entry:
```json
{
  "filename": "features/dashboard.png",
  "url": "https://fireflygrove.app/marketing/screenshots/features/dashboard.png",
  "title": "Family Grove Dashboard",
  "description": "Organize memories by family branches",
  "tags": ["dashboard", "family", "memories", "organization"],
  "platform": ["pinterest", "facebook"],
  "topics": ["digital legacy", "family memories"],
  "aspectRatio": "2:3",
  "pinterestOptimized": true,
  "uploadedAt": "2025-01-15"
}
```

#### 3. Test Auto-Publishing (5 minutes)
1. Create a draft Pinterest post in Marketing Genius
2. Approve the post
3. Schedule it for immediate publishing
4. Check that it appears on your "Firefly Grove" Pinterest board with an image

#### 4. Set Up Cron Job (5 minutes)
If not already set up, add to `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "crons": [{
    "path": "/api/cron/publish-scheduled",
    "schedule": "0 9 * * *"
  }]
}
```

This will auto-publish approved posts daily at 9 AM.
