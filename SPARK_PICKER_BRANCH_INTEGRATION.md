# ‚ú® Spark Picker Integration on Branch Page

## Problem Solved

Users uploaded spark collections via Settings ‚Üí Upload Prompts but couldn't actually use them when creating memories on branches. The branch page only showed random hardcoded sparks with no way to access uploaded collections.

---

## Solution

Added a **"My Sparks"** button on the branch page that opens the SparkPicker modal, allowing users to:
1. Browse all their uploaded spark collections
2. See "My Sparks" and "Shared Sparks" sections
3. Select any prompt from their collections
4. Use it immediately when creating a memory

---

## What Changed

### File Modified: `app/branch/[branchId]/page.tsx`

**1. Added SparkPicker Import**
```typescript
import SparkPicker from '@/components/SparkPicker'
```

**2. Added State for SparkPicker**
```typescript
const [showSparkPicker, setShowSparkPicker] = useState(false)
```

**3. Added "My Sparks" Button**

Added next to the existing refresh (üîÑ) button:

```tsx
<button
  onClick={() => setShowSparkPicker(true)}
  className="..."
  title="Choose from your spark collections"
>
  <svg>üì¶ icon</svg>
  <span className="hidden sm:inline">My Sparks</span>
</button>
```

**Before:**
```
‚ú® Story Spark              [üîÑ]
"What was your favorite tradition?"
[Light a Memory]
```

**After:**
```
‚ú® Story Spark       [üì¶ My Sparks] [üîÑ]
"What was your favorite tradition?"
[Light a Memory]
```

**4. Added SparkPicker Modal**

```tsx
{showSparkPicker && (
  <SparkPicker
    onSelect={(sparkText) => {
      setCurrentSpark(sparkText)
      setShowSparkPicker(false)
    }}
    onClose={() => setShowSparkPicker(false)}
  />
)}
```

---

## Button Behavior

### My Sparks Button
- **Icon:** üì¶ (collection/archive icon)
- **Label:** "My Sparks" (hidden on mobile)
- **Action:** Opens SparkPicker modal
- **Placement:** Between title and refresh button

### Refresh Button (Existing)
- **Icon:** üîÑ (refresh/rotate icon)
- **Action:** Gets random hardcoded spark
- **Placement:** Right side
- **Still works:** For quick random inspiration

**User Can:**
- Click "My Sparks" ‚Üí Choose from collections
- Click "üîÑ" ‚Üí Get random spark
- Use both interchangeably

---

## No Dropdown Needed!

**Why User Saw No Dropdown:**

The system doesn't use a dropdown for collection selection. Instead:
1. "My Sparks" button opens a **full modal** (SparkPicker)
2. Modal shows ALL collections organized by sections
3. User can browse, filter, and select
4. Much better UX than a dropdown!

**Even with ONE collection:**
- SparkPicker still opens
- Shows "My Sparks" section with that 1 collection
- User can see all prompts in that collection
- Can select any prompt
- Still shows "Shared Sparks" if Grove members are sharing

---

## Technical Details

### State Management
```typescript
// Existing spark state (unchanged)
const [currentSpark, setCurrentSpark] = useState('')

// New: Show/hide SparkPicker
const [showSparkPicker, setShowSparkPicker] = useState(false)
```

### Spark Selection Handler
```typescript
onSelect={(sparkText) => {
  setCurrentSpark(sparkText)  // Update displayed spark
  setShowSparkPicker(false)   // Close modal
}}
```

### Two Ways to Get Sparks

**Option 1: Random (Existing)**
```typescript
refreshSpark() // Gets random from hardcoded list
```

**Option 2: Choose from Collections (New)**
```typescript
setShowSparkPicker(true) // Opens picker
// User selects ‚Üí setCurrentSpark(sparkText)
```

## Answer to User's Question

**Question:** "Is it because I only have one file?"

**Answer:** No! The system doesn't show a dropdown at all. Instead:

1. You click the **"My Sparks"** button (new button added)
2. A full modal opens showing ALL your collections
3. Even with 1 collection, you'll see all 25+ prompts inside it
4. You can select any prompt you want

The benefit of having multiple collections is better organization, but even with 1 collection, you can now browse and select from all your uploaded prompts!
