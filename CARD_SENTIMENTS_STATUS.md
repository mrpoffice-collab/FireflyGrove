# Card Sentiments System - Current Status

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Last Commit:** `91ac1cd` - Fix card sentiments system and landing page

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. CSV Structure Overhaul
- **File:** `config/card-sentiments.csv`
- **Changed:** Category column now uses database category names (not poetic names)
- **Before:** "In the Quiet of Loss", "Another Year of Light", etc.
- **After:** "Sympathy & Condolence", "Birthday", "Christmas & Holiday", etc.
- **Result:** 12 categories × 3 sentiments each = 36 total sentiments

### 2. API Simplification
- **File:** `app/api/cards/sentiments/route.ts`
- **Changed:** Removed 26 lines of category mapping code
- **Logic:** Direct exact match between `category.name` (from DB) and `record.Category` (from CSV)
- **Code:**
```typescript
const sentiments = records
  .filter((record: any) => {
    return record.Category === category.name
  })
  .map((record: any, index: number) => ({
    id: `csv-${categoryId}-${index}`,
    coverMessage: record.Front,
    insideMessage: record.Inside,
    tags: record.Tags || '',
  }))
```

### 3. SentimentPicker UI Complete Redesign
- **File:** `components/SentimentPicker.tsx`
- **New Features:**
  - Large preview cards (not compact boxes)
  - Card envelope icon 💌 for front message
  - Book icon 📖 for inside message
  - Bigger text (18px front, 16px inside)
  - "Option 1/2/3" labeling
  - Glowing border on selected sentiment
  - "Click to select this message" hints
  - Max height 700px with scroll

### 4. Cards Landing Page Updates
- **File:** `app/cards/page.tsx`
- **Added:** 4 missing categories (now shows all 12):
  - 🌅 Encouragement & Healing
  - ✨ Friendship & Connection
  - 🐾 Pet Remembrance
  - 💛 Just Because
- **Changed:** Pricing box now says "Complimentary for Grove Owners"
- **Changed:** Moved CTA button into pricing box (removed bottom CTA section)

## ⚠️ CURRENT ISSUE

**User Report:** "the sentiment did not do as expected nothing changed on the create page"

**Location:** Production at `/cards/create`
**Environment:** Vercel deployment
**Symptoms:** Sentiments UI appears unchanged despite code being committed and deployed

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Completed

1. ✅ Code verified in commit `91ac1cd`
2. ✅ Git push successful to main branch
3. ✅ Build completed successfully locally (`npm run build`)
4. ✅ CSV file contains correct category names
5. ✅ SentimentPicker.tsx contains new UI code
6. ✅ API route contains simplified matching logic

---

## 🐛 Potential Causes

### 1. Vercel Deployment Not Complete
- **Check:** Vercel dashboard for deployment status
- **Expected:** Commit `91ac1cd` should show "Ready" status
- **Action:** Wait for deployment to finish (1-2 min)

### 2. Browser Cache
- **Issue:** Old JavaScript bundle cached
- **Solution:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or clear cache completely
- **Verification:** Check Network tab → sentiments.tsx should have new code

### 3. API Not Returning Sentiments
- **Check:** Browser console (F12) → Network tab
- **Look for:** GET request to `/api/cards/sentiments?categoryId=xxx`
- **Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "sentiments": [
    {
      "id": "csv-xxx-0",
      "coverMessage": "Some people aren't just part of our story...",
      "insideMessage": "In quiet moments, their memory glows softly...",
      "tags": "sympathy,condolence,poetic,firefly,memorial"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
- **If empty:** Category matching failing
- **If error:** Authentication or file read issue

### 4. Production Database Categories Mismatch
- **Issue:** Production DB might still have old category names
- **Check:** Run `npx ts-node scripts/check-categories.ts` against production DB
- **Expected:** All 12 categories with names matching CSV
- **If mismatch:** Need to run category update scripts in production

### 5. CSV File Not Deployed
- **Issue:** Vercel might not be deploying `/config` folder
- **Check:** Vercel logs or file tree in deployment
- **Solution:** Ensure `config/` is not in `.vercelignore`

## 🔧 Next Debug Steps

### Step 1: Verify Production Deployment
```bash
# Check latest commit deployed
curl https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/cards/categories | jq
```
Should return 12 categories with correct names.

### Step 2: Test Sentiment API Directly
```bash
# Get a category ID first, then test sentiments
curl https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/cards/sentiments?categoryId=CATEGORY_ID
```
Should return 3 sentiments with Front/Inside messages.

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
1. Open `/cards/create` in production
2. Select "Sympathy & Condolence" category
3. Open F12 → Network tab
4. Look for `/api/cards/sentiments` request
5. Check response body

### Step 4: Verify Component Rendering
1. Open F12 → Elements tab
2. Inspect the sentiment picker section
3. Look for class names like `text-2xl` (for 💌 icon)
4. If old class names present → cache issue
5. If new class names present → CSS/styling issue

## 📝 Key Files & Locations

### CSV Data
- **Path:** `config/card-sentiments.csv`
- **Format:** `Category,Front,Inside,Tags`
- **Categories:** Must match database names exactly
- **Sentiments:** 3 per category

### API Route
- **Path:** `app/api/cards/sentiments/route.ts`
- **Method:** GET
- **Params:** `categoryId` (required)
- **Returns:** Array of sentiments

### UI Component
- **Path:** `components/SentimentPicker.tsx`
- **Props:** `categoryId`, `selectedSentiment`, `onSelect`
- **Displays:** Large preview cards with front/inside messages

### Database Categories
- **Table:** `CardCategory`
- **Expected Count:** 12 active categories
- **Check Script:** `scripts/check-categories.ts`
- **Update Script:** `scripts/update-card-categories.ts`

---

## 🚀 Production Database Scripts

If categories don't match in production, run these in order:

```bash
# 1. Update 8 main category names (if needed)
npx ts-node scripts/update-card-categories.ts

# 2. Activate 4 additional categories
npx ts-node scripts/activate-all-categories.ts

# 3. Verify all 12 are active
npx ts-node scripts/check-categories.ts
```

**Note:** These scripts connect to your production database via `DATABASE_URL` env var.

---

## ✅ Expected Working State

When everything is working correctly:

1. **Landing page** (`/cards`) shows all 12 category icons
2. **Create page** (`/cards/create`) lets user select from 12 categories
3. **After selecting category:**
   - "Firefly Grove Message" section appears
   - Shows "3 options" in header
   - Displays 3 large preview cards
   - Each card shows:
     - Option number (Option 1, 2, or 3)
     - 💌 Card Front with italic text
     - 📖 Inside Message with multi-line text
     - "Click to select" hint (if not selected)
     - Glowing border + checkmark (if selected)

4. **API Response:**
```json
{
  "sentiments": [
    {"id": "csv-xxx-0", "coverMessage": "...", "insideMessage": "...", "tags": "..."},
    {"id": "csv-xxx-1", "coverMessage": "...", "insideMessage": "...", "tags": "..."},
    {"id": "csv-xxx-2", "coverMessage": "...", "insideMessage": "...", "tags": "..."}
  ]
}
```

   - Verify database has correct category names

2. **Re-deploy:**
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Force redeploy"
git push
```

3. **Check Build Logs:**
   - Look for CSV parsing errors
   - Look for component import errors

rm -rf .next
npm run build
npm run start
# Visit http://localhost:3000/cards/create
```
