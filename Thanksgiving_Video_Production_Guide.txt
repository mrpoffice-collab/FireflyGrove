‚ùì FAQ FOR GRANDSON
================================================================================

Q: I've never done screen recording before. Is it hard?
A: Nope! On iPhone it's built-in. Swipe down, tap the record button, do your
thing, tap to stop. That's it.

Q: Do I need professional equipment?
A: Your phone is perfect. Natural light is great. Keep it simple.

Q: What if I mess up while recording?
A: Just pause, collect yourself, and keep going. You'll edit out the mistakes
later.

Q: How long will this take?
A: 2 hours filming, 3-4 hours editing if you're new. Faster if you've edited
before.

A: Ideally yes (adds authenticity), but you can do voiceover-only if you
prefer.

Q: What if the app doesn't have the exact feature the script mentions?
A: Text me! I'll adjust the script to match what actually exists.
