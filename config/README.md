# Card Sentiments Configuration

This file controls all the front and inside messages for Firefly Grove greeting cards.

## How to Edit Sentiments

1. Open `config/card-sentiments.json`
2. Edit any sentiment's `cover` (front message) or `inside` (inside message)
3. Save the file
4. Run the update command (see below)
5. Deploy to Vercel

## Updating Sentiments

### Locally
```bash
npm run update-sentiments
```

### After Deploying to Vercel
The sentiments are stored in the database, so you'll need to:
1. Edit `config/card-sentiments.json`
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. SSH into your Vercel deployment or use a database client
4. Run the update script against your production database

Or better yet:
1. Edit locally
2. Run `npm run update-sentiments` locally (connected to prod DB)
3. Commit the config file changes
4. Push to deploy

## Formatting Tips

- Use `\n` for line breaks in poetry/verse formatting
- Keep front messages short and impactful (1-2 lines)
- Inside messages can be longer and more poetic
- Maintain Firefly Grove's warm, metaphorical voice
- Use firefly/light/warmth imagery when appropriate

}
```

## Firefly Grove Voice Guide

When writing sentiments, remember:
- âœ¨ Use light/firefly metaphors naturally
- ðŸŒ¿ Keep it warm but not overly sentimental
- ðŸ’› Focus on connection and presence
- ðŸŒ™ Embrace quiet, contemplative moments
- âœ¦ "You're seen" over "You're special"

Good examples:
- "Like fireflies dancing through dusk"
- "The light always returns â€” even after the longest night"
- "You're one of the steady lights I look for in the dark"
- "Their joy was simple, their love was pure â€” and it still glows"
