```

  - Natural Firefly Grove product mentions

- Creates SEO-friendly slug from title
- Updates database status to "published"

### 🔍 Reddit Trend Scanner (Weekly)

**Time Required:** 2-3 minutes
**Output:** 50-150 trending topic ideas

```bash
# From project root
node scripts/scan-reddit-local.js
```

**What It Does:**
- Scans 15 relevant subreddits:
  - Genealogy, FamilyHistory, GriefSupport
  - Parenting, Mommit, daddit, AskParents
  - SandwichGeneration, AgingParents
  - MemoryKeeping, Scrapbooking
  - OldPhotos, TheWayWeWere
  - estrangedadultchild, LifeAfterNarcissism
- Filters for high-engagement posts (10+ upvotes OR 5+ comments)
- Extracts keywords automatically
- Generates content ideas
- Saves to production database
- Rate limits: 2 seconds between subreddits

**Output Example:**
```
✅ Saved: "When you're the only one in the family excited about dead relatives..."

## Troubleshooting

### "No posts generated" after auto-write
**Cause:** No planned topics in calendar
**Fix:** Click "Generate Content Plan" first

### "Failed to generate topics with AI"
**Cause:** OpenAI API key not set or invalid
**Fix:** Check Vercel environment variables, ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set

### Reddit scanner returns 403 errors
**Cause:** Reddit blocks Vercel servers
**Fix:** Use local script: `node scripts/scan-reddit-local.js`

### Draft Posts section shows (0)
**Cause:** Auto-write still running OR failed silently
**Fix:**
1. Wait 1-2 minutes for auto-write to complete
2. Check Vercel logs for errors
3. Try manual generation to test

### Published post not showing on /blog
**Cause:** Markdown file not created OR wrong format
**Fix:**
1. Check `content/blog/` directory for .md file
2. Verify frontmatter format matches existing posts
3. Check Next.js build logs

### "Unauthorized" when accessing /marketing-genius
**Cause:** Not logged in as admin
**Fix:**
1. Log in to Firefly Grove
2. Ensure your user has admin privileges
3. Check database: `isAdmin = true` in User table

   "Why Your Grandchildren Will Thank You for Doing This Now"

4. Pin descriptions (500 chars):

2. Rewrite each as a helpful Reddit post:
   - Start with relatable problem/story
   - Share the solution (from blog)
   - Add personal context
   - Mention blog ONLY if asked

3. Example transformation:

   Blog H2: "How to Digitize Old Photos Without Spending $1000"

   Reddit Post:
   Title: "Digitized 500 family photos for under $50 - here's how"

   Body:
   "My grandmother passed away last year, and I inherited boxes of
   old photos. Professional scanning would have cost $800+, so I
   found a better way.

   What I did:
   - Borrowed a decent scanner from library (free)
   - Used Google PhotoScan app for damaged photos ($0)
   - Organized with [method from blog]
   - Total cost: $35 for storage

   Tips that saved me:
   [Key points from blog post]

   Happy to answer questions!"

4. Subreddits to target:
   - r/Genealogy (family history)
   - r/Parenting (memory-making)
   - r/GriefSupport (memorial ideas)
   - r/LifeProTips (organization tips)
   - r/declutter (organizing photos)

5. Timing: Wait 1 week after blog publish
6. Frequency: 1-2 posts per week (don't spam)
```

**Reddit Golden Rules:**
- NEVER lead with product mention
- Focus on genuinely helping
- Be transparent if asked about Firefly Grove
- Engage with comments (build relationships)
- Share personal stories, not sales pitches

### 📘 Facebook (Community Building - Warm Audience)

**Goal:** Build engaged community, nurture leads
**Format:** Conversational posts with images

**Repurposing Process:**
```
1. Extract emotional stories/stats from blog
2. Rewrite as conversation starters:

   Blog opening: "78% of families wish they had recorded
   their grandparents' stories before it was too late."

   Facebook Post:
   "My biggest regret? 😢

   I never asked my grandmother about her childhood in Italy.
   She passed away last year, and now those stories are gone forever.

   I see so many of you sharing family photos and memories here.
   Can I ask - have you recorded your parents' or grandparents'
   stories yet?

   If not, here are 3 questions to ask them this weekend:
   [Key points from blog]

   What's one story you wish you had asked about?
   Comment below 👇"

3. Post types to create:
   - Question posts (drive engagement)
   - Tip posts (quick value)
   - Story posts (emotional connection)

   - Poll posts (interactive)

4. Facebook Groups to share in:
   - Family history groups
   - Parenting groups (local and national)
   - Grief support communities

   - Memory keeping groups

5. Schedule: 3-5 posts per week
```

**Facebook Content Calendar from 1 Blog Post:**
- Monday: Question post (conversation starter)
- Wednesday: Tip post (actionable advice)
- Friday: Story post (emotional/inspirational)
- Weekend: Photo post (nostalgic/relatable)

### 🐦 Twitter/X (Thought Leadership - Quick Tips)

**Goal:** Build authority, drive traffic
**Format:** Threads (8-12 tweets)

**Repurposing Process:**
```
1. Turn blog into thread:

   Tweet 1 (Hook):
   "I helped my mom organize 60 years of family photos last weekend.

   Here's the system that actually worked (and why most people
   fail at this): 🧵"

   Tweet 2-11 (Key points from blog):
   Each H3 section = 1 tweet
   - Keep it conversational

## Content Repurposing Workflow

### Week 1: Blog Published
```
Monday: Publish blog post on Firefly Grove
Tuesday: Create 10 Pinterest pins
Wednesday: Schedule pins (2/day for 5 days)
Thursday: Write 2 Reddit posts
Friday: Create Facebook post calendar (5 posts)
Weekend: Write email newsletter
```

### Week 2: Maximum Distribution
```
Monday: Post to Reddit (1st post)
Tuesday: Facebook post #1
Wednesday: Twitter thread
Thursday: Reddit post #2
Friday: Facebook post #2
Weekend: Send email newsletter
```

### Week 3: Continued Promotion
```
Continue Pinterest pins
Continue Facebook posts
Repurpose into video content
Monitor engagement and comments
```

### Tracking What Works
```
Create simple spreadsheet:
- Platform
- Post type
- Engagement (views, clicks, comments)
- Traffic to blog (use UTM parameters)
- Signups attributed

Focus more on what works, less on what doesn't.
```

## Content Multiplier Effect

**One 2000-word blog post** =

| Platform | Content Pieces | Time Required | Traffic Potential |
|----------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Blog | 1 post | 2 min (AI) | 100-500 views/month |
| Pinterest | 10 pins | 30 min | 500-2000 views/month |
| Reddit | 3 posts | 20 min | 100-1000 views each |
| Facebook | 5 posts | 15 min | 50-200 reach each |
| Twitter | 1 thread | 10 min | 100-500 views |
| Email | 3 emails | 20 min | 100% open rate (subscribers) |
| **TOTAL** | **23 pieces** | **~2 hours** | **2000-5000+ views** |

**Without AI:** 3 hours to write blog + 2 hours to repurpose = 5 hours total

**With AI:** 2 minutes to generate + 2 hours to repurpose = 2 hours total

**Time saved:** 60% 🚀
