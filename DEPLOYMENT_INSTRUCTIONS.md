## ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED: Production Database Migration

The production database needs the new `isSharedWithGrove` field added to the `SparkCollection` table.

### Option 1: Run Migration Script (Recommended)

1. **Update the migration script to use production DATABASE_URL:**

```bash
# In scripts/add-grove-sharing-field.ts, it already uses process.env.DATABASE_URL
# Just need to run it with production env vars
```

2. **Run the migration:**

```bash
# Set production DATABASE_URL temporarily
$env:DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[neon-production-url]"
npx tsx scripts/add-grove-sharing-field.ts
```

3. **Verify:**
```bash
# Check that the field exists
npx prisma studio
# Navigate to SparkCollection model
# Verify isSharedWithGrove field is present
```

### Option 2: Manual SQL (Alternative)

If you prefer to run SQL directly in Neon console:

1. Go to: https://console.neon.tech/
2. Select your Firefly Grove database
3. Open SQL Editor
4. Run this SQL:

```sql
-- Add isSharedWithGrove field
ALTER TABLE "SparkCollection"
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "isSharedWithGrove" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;

-- Create index for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS "SparkCollection_isSharedWithGrove_idx"
ON "SparkCollection"("isSharedWithGrove");
```

5. Verify the changes:
```sql
-- Check the column exists
SELECT column_name, data_type, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'SparkCollection'
  AND column_name = 'isSharedWithGrove';

-- Should return:
-- column_name          | data_type | column_default
-- isSharedWithGrove    | boolean   | false
```

## Vercel Deployment Status

### Automatic Deployment
- ‚úÖ Code is pushed to GitHub
- ‚è≥ Vercel will auto-deploy in ~2-3 minutes
- üîó Check status: https://vercel.com/[your-project]/deployments

### Environment Variables
All required env vars should already be set in Vercel:
- ‚úÖ `DATABASE_URL` (Neon connection string)
- ‚úÖ `PINTEREST_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- ‚úÖ `PINTEREST_BOARD_ID`
- ‚úÖ `PINTEREST_APP_ID`
- ‚úÖ `PINTEREST_APP_SECRET`

**Note:** The Pinterest token in .env.local has been removed from the git repo for security. Make sure it's set in Vercel environment variables.

## Post-Deployment Testing

Once Vercel deployment completes and database migration is done:

### Test 1: Settings Navigation
1. Log into production site
2. Click your avatar/name in header
3. Click "‚öôÔ∏è Settings"
4. Verify "‚ú® Upload Prompts" appears
5. Click it ‚Üí Should navigate to /spark-collections

### Test 2: Collection Sharing
1. Go to /spark-collections
2. Upload a test collection or use existing one
3. Toggle the "Share" switch
4. Verify it turns blue
5. Log in as a different user in the same Grove
6. Open SparkPicker on any branch
7. Verify "Shared Sparks" section appears
8. Verify you can see the shared collection

### Test 3: SparkPicker Sections
1. Create/activate at least one personal collection
2. Open memory modal on any branch
3. Click "Use Spark"
4. Verify two sections appear:
   - "‚ö° My Sparks" (with your collections)
   - "üîµ Shared Sparks" (if any Grove members are sharing)

### Test 4: Spark Formatting
1. Use a spark prompt from SparkPicker
2. Verify it appears centered and bold with colon
3. Type a response below it
4. Save memory
5. View memory in card view
6. Verify prompt is still formatted correctly

### Test 5: FireflyBurst Sizing
1. Find a memory with a large image
2. Open Firefly Burst (slideshow view)
3. Verify image scales properly (not cut off)
4. Test with long text content
5. Verify scrolling works

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If something goes wrong:

### Rollback Code
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert dfb2ef8
git push

# Or rollback in Vercel dashboard:
# 1. Go to Deployments
# 2. Find previous working deployment
# 3. Click "..." ‚Üí "Promote to Production"
```

### Rollback Database
```sql
-- Remove the new field (only if absolutely necessary)
ALTER TABLE "SparkCollection"
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "isSharedWithGrove";

DROP INDEX IF EXISTS "SparkCollection_isSharedWithGrove_idx";
```

**Note:** Only rollback database if there are critical issues. The field defaults to `false` so it won't affect existing functionality.

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Grove-only sharing**: Cannot share with specific users, only entire Grove
2. **No notifications**: Users aren't notified when someone shares a collection
3. **No analytics**: Can't see how often shared prompts are used

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Share with specific users instead of entire Grove
- Notifications when new collections are shared
- Usage analytics for shared prompts
- Ability to duplicate/fork shared collections
- Collection categories and filtering
