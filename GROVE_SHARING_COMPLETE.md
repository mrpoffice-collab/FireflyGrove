# ✅ Grove-Wide Spark Sharing Implementation - COMPLETE

## Overview

Successfully implemented a complete Grove-wide sharing system for Spark Collections. Users can now:
1. Upload their own prompt collections via Settings → Upload Prompts
2. Share collections with all users in their Grove
3. View shared collections from connected users in a separate "Shared Sparks" section
4. Toggle sharing on/off for each collection

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Navigation Updates ✅

**File:** `components/Header.tsx`

**Desktop Dropdown Menu:**
- Replaced direct "✨ Manage Spark Collections" link with a collapsible "⚙️ Settings" menu
- Settings submenu includes:
  - ✨ Upload Prompts (links to /spark-collections)
  - (Expandable for future settings options)

**Mobile Menu:**
- Added "Settings" section with:
  - ✨ Upload Prompts
  - 💳 Manage Plan

**User Experience:**
```
User Avatar Dropdown
├── Manage Plan
├── ⚙️ Settings ▶
│   └── ✨ Upload Prompts
├── 🐛 Report an Issue
└── Sign Out
```

---

### 2. Database Schema Updates ✅

**File:** `prisma/schema.prisma`

Added new field to `SparkCollection` model:
```prisma
model SparkCollection {
  // ... existing fields
  isSharedWithGrove Boolean @default(false) // User-created collection shared with all users in their Grove

  @@index([isSharedWithGrove])
}
```

**Migration Script:** `scripts/add-grove-sharing-field.ts`
- Adds `isSharedWithGrove` column with default `false`
- Creates index for performance
- Successfully executed ✅

---

### 3. API Endpoints ✅

#### a) Updated Spark Fetching API
**File:** `app/api/sparks/route.ts`

**New Logic:**
1. Fetches user's own active collections
2. Finds all users in the same Grove
3. Fetches collections where `isSharedWithGrove = true` from Grove members
4. Combines both sets for the response

**Returns:** Sparks from:
- User's own active collections
- Grove-shared collections from other users

**New Fields in Response:**
```typescript
{
  collection: {
    id: string
    name: string
    icon: string | null
    userId: string | null
    isSharedWithGrove: boolean  // NEW
  }
}
```

#### b) Collection Sharing Toggle API
**File:** `app/api/spark-collections/[id]/share/route.ts` ✨ NEW

**POST /api/spark-collections/:id/share**
- Toggles `isSharedWithGrove` flag
- Validates ownership (user can only share their own collections)
- Returns updated sharing status

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "isSharedWithGrove": true
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "isSharedWithGrove": true
}
```

#### c) User Session API
**File:** `app/api/user/session/route.ts` ✨ NEW

**GET /api/user/session**
- Returns current user's ID, name, and email
- Used by SparkPicker to determine which collections are "mine" vs "shared"

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "user_id",
  "name": "User Name",
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

#### d) Updated Collections List API
**File:** `app/api/spark-collections/route.ts`

**Updated Response:**
Now includes `isSharedWithGrove` field in transformed collections:
```typescript
{
  id: string
  name: string
  isSharedWithGrove: boolean  // NEW
  isActive: boolean
  // ... other fields
}
```

### 4. SparkPicker UI Updates ✅

**File:** `components/SparkPicker.tsx`

**New Features:**

1. **Separated Sections:**
   - "My Sparks" section (firefly-glow theme)
   - "Shared Sparks" section (blue theme)

2. **Collection Attribution:**
   - Shared collections show creator name: "by [Creator Name]"

3. **Visual Differentiation:**
   - My Sparks: Firefly-glow borders and highlights
   - Shared Sparks: Blue borders and highlights
   - "Shared" badge on all shared prompts

**Before:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ All Sparks (mixed together) │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Collection A                │
│ Collection B (from friend)  │ ← Not distinguished
│ Collection C                │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**After:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚡ My Sparks (15 prompts)   │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ 📚 My Reading Prompts       │
│ ✨ Family Traditions        │
└─────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔵 Shared Sparks (8 prompts)│
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ 🎨 Art Memories by Sarah    │
│ 🏃 Sports Stories by Mike   │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Grouping Logic:**
```typescript
// Separate user's own sparks from shared sparks
const mySparks = filteredSparks.filter(spark =>
  !spark.collection?.isSharedWithGrove ||
  spark.collection?.userId === currentUserId
)

const sharedSparks = filteredSparks.filter(spark =>
  spark.collection?.isSharedWithGrove &&
  spark.collection?.userId !== currentUserId
)
```

---

### 5. Collection Management UI Updates ✅

**File:** `app/spark-collections/page.tsx`

**New Sharing Controls:**

Added toggle switch next to each collection:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📚 My Reading Prompts                  │
│ 25 prompts • Created Jan 15, 2025      │
│                                        │
│              [Active] [Share] [Delete] │
│                 ✓        ○             │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Toggle States:**
- **Active Toggle (Gold):** Enables/disables collection for personal use
- **Share Toggle (Blue):** Shares collection with all Grove members
- **Delete Button (Red):** Removes collection entirely

**New Handler:**
```typescript
const handleToggleSharing = async (collectionId: string, currentState: boolean) => {
  await fetch(`/api/spark-collections/${collectionId}/share`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ isSharedWithGrove: !currentState }),
  })
  fetchCollections() // Refresh list
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Upload Flow

1. **User clicks avatar** → Opens dropdown menu
2. **User clicks "⚙️ Settings"** → Expands submenu
3. **User clicks "✨ Upload Prompts"** → Navigates to `/spark-collections`
4. **User clicks "+ Upload New Collection"** → Opens upload modal
5. **User uploads .txt file** → Collection is created
6. **Collection appears in "My Collections"** → With Active & Share toggles

### Sharing Flow

1. **User has a collection** they want to share
2. **User toggles "Share" switch** → Turns blue
3. **All users in the same Grove** can now see this collection
4. **Collection appears in their SparkPicker** → Under "Shared Sparks" section
5. **Friends see attribution:** "by [Your Name]"

### Using Shared Prompts

1. **User opens memory modal** on any branch
2. **User clicks "Use Spark"** → Opens SparkPicker
3. **User sees two sections:**
   - My Sparks (their own collections)
   - Shared Sparks (from Grove friends)
4. **User selects a shared prompt** → It works exactly like their own prompts
5. **Prompt is inserted** with centered, bold formatting

## Technical Details

### How Grove Sharing Works

**Grove Structure:**
- Each User belongs to ONE Grove
- A Grove contains multiple Users
- Users in the same Grove are "connected"

**Sharing Query Logic:**
```typescript
// 1. Get current user's Grove
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: userId },
  include: { grove: true }
})

// 2. Find all users in the same Grove
const groveUsers = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    grove: { id: user.grove.id },
    id: { not: userId } // Exclude self
  }
})

// 3. Find shared collections from those users
const sharedCollections = await prisma.sparkCollection.findMany({
  where: {
    userId: { in: groveUserIds },
    isSharedWithGrove: true
  }
})
```

### Permission Model

**Who can share:**
- ✅ Collection owner (userId matches)
- ❌ Other users (403 Forbidden)

**Who can see shared collections:**
- ✅ All users in the same Grove
- ❌ Users in different Groves

**What happens when sharing is toggled off:**
- Collection immediately disappears from other users' SparkPicker
- No data is deleted
- Can be re-enabled anytime

## Testing Scenarios

### ✅ Scenario 1: Upload and Share
1. User A uploads "Family Questions.txt"
2. Collection appears in "My Collections"
3. User A toggles "Share" on
4. User B (in same Grove) opens SparkPicker
5. **Result:** Collection appears in User B's "Shared Sparks" section

### ✅ Scenario 2: Toggle Sharing Off
1. User A has shared collection
2. User A toggles "Share" off
3. User B (in same Grove) opens SparkPicker
4. **Result:** Collection no longer appears for User B

### ✅ Scenario 3: Different Groves
1. User A in Grove 1 shares collection
2. User C in Grove 2 opens SparkPicker
3. **Result:** User C does NOT see User A's shared collection

### ✅ Scenario 4: Attribution
1. User A shares "Bible Verses" collection
2. User B views SparkPicker
3. **Result:** Collection shows "Bible Verses by [User A's Name]"

### ✅ Scenario 5: Using Shared Prompt
1. User B clicks shared prompt from User A
2. Prompt is inserted into memory
3. **Result:** Works exactly like own prompts, with formatted text

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Could Add Later:
1. **Share with Specific Users:** Instead of all Grove members
2. **Collection Categories:** Filter shared collections by topic
3. **Usage Analytics:** See how many times shared prompts are used
4. **Copy to My Collections:** Duplicate a shared collection to customize it
5. **Collaborative Collections:** Multiple users can add prompts
6. **Notifications:** Alert when someone shares a new collection
7. **Preview Before Activating:** See prompts before adding to personal list
