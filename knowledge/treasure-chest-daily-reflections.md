# Treasure Chest: Daily Reflections

Capture one moment worth remembering, every day. Build a glow trail of small treasures that, together, tell the story of your life.

---

## What Is Treasure Chest?

Treasure Chest is your daily reflection practice. Each day, you're prompted to capture one thing:

- A moment worth remembering
- Something you're grateful for
- A small observation
- A feeling or realization
- A funny thing that happened

These aren't full memories — they're quick captures. Think of them as:
- **Journal entry** (a few sentences)
- **Photo note** (a picture with caption)
- **Voice memo** (30-second reflection)

Over time, these daily treasures become a rich tapestry of your everyday life.

## Why Daily Treasures?

### Life Happens in Small Moments

The big events are easy to remember. It's the small moments that fade:
- The way sunlight hit the kitchen counter
- Your daughter's joke at breakfast
- The perfect cup of coffee
- A stranger's kindness

Treasure Chest helps you notice and preserve these fleeting moments.

### Building a Habit

- 💫 **Consistency over perfection**
  One small entry per day is more valuable than occasional long entries.

- 🌿 **Your glow trail**
  Each daily treasure extends your "streak" — a visible trail of days you've shown up.

- ✨ **Grace tokens**
  Missed a day? Use a grace token (2 per month) to keep your streak alive.

- 🔥 **The longest streak**
  Track your all-time longest streak. Many users reach 100+ days.

### Capturing Your Treasure

1. **Read the prompt**

   Each day has a different prompt to spark reflection:
   - "What made you smile today?"
   - "What are you grateful for in this moment?"
   - "What small victory did you have?"
   - "What did you notice that others might have missed?"

2. **Choose your format**

   - **Write**: A few sentences or a full paragraph
   - **Voice**: 30-second to 2-minute audio recording
   - **Photo**: Upload a photo with optional caption
   - **Combination**: Photo + text, or voice + text

3. **Assign to a branch (optional)**

   Link your treasure to a specific person/branch, or leave it in your general journal.

4. **Save**

   Your treasure is saved. Your streak increments. Tomorrow's prompt awaits.

## Understanding Your Streak

### Current Streak
The number of consecutive days you've captured a treasure.

**Example:**
- Captured yesterday: ✅
- Captured today: ✅
- Current streak: 47 days

### Glow Trail
The visual representation of your streak — each day adds a glow.

### Longest Streak
Your all-time record. This stays even if your current streak breaks.

## Grace Tokens: Never Lose Your Streak

Life happens. You forget, get busy, or travel without internet.

**Grace tokens** let you save your streak:

- You get **2 grace tokens per month**
- Use a token to "fill in" a missed day retroactively
- Write a quick reflection for yesterday
- Your streak continues unbroken
- Tokens refresh on the 1st of each month

**When to use grace:**
- You were sick and forgot
- Traveling and had no internet
- Just realized at midnight you didn't capture today's treasure

**Pro tip:** Don't waste grace on early days. A 3-day streak breaking isn't tragic. Save tokens for when your streak is 50+ days.

## Prompts & Categories

### Daily Prompts Rotate

Each day, you get a different prompt from these categories:

- **Gratitude**: What are you thankful for?
- **Joy**: What made you smile?
- **Wonder**: What surprised or delighted you?
- **Connection**: Who touched your life today?
- **Growth**: What did you learn?
- **Beauty**: What caught your eye?
- **Small Wins**: What went right?

### You Can Ignore the Prompt

The prompt is optional. You can always write about whatever you want. It's just there to help when you're stuck.

## Tips & Best Practices

- 💡 **Set a daily reminder**
  Most people do treasure chest at the same time daily: morning coffee, before bed, lunch break.

- 💡 **Start small**
  One sentence counts. Don't let perfectionism stop you from starting.

- 💡 **Use your phone**
  Quick voice recordings while driving or photos throughout the day make it effortless.

- 💡 **Link to branches when relevant**
  If your treasure is about your daughter, link it to her branch. Unassigned treasures go to your personal journal.

- 💡 **Review old treasures**
  Once a month, browse your past treasures. You'll be amazed what you would have forgotten.

- 💡 **Don't stress about streaks**
  The real value is the practice, not the number. A 10-day streak with genuine reflections beats a 100-day streak of "I'm tired, goodnight."

## Viewing Your Treasure History

**Three ways to view:**

1. **Timeline View** → Scroll through all treasures chronologically
2. **Calendar View** → See which days you captured treasures
3. **Branch View** → Treasures linked to specific branches appear in those branch timelines

## Common Questions

**Q: What's the difference between a treasure and a regular memory?**

A: Treasures are quick daily captures. Memories are fuller stories. Think of treasures as journal entries, memories as photo album pages with full context.

**Q: Can I go back and add treasures for past days?**

A: Only with grace tokens, and only for the previous 2-3 days. Treasure Chest is about present awareness, not retroactive documentation.

**Q: Can I edit treasures after saving them?**

A: Yes! Click on any treasure in your history to edit or expand it.

**Q: Do treasures count toward my storage limit?**

A: Yes, but they're typically very small (text is negligible, short audio is small, photos count normally).

**Q: Can I skip the prompt and just write what I want?**

A: Absolutely. The prompt is a suggestion, not a requirement.

**Q: What if I have nothing interesting to say?**

A: That's fine. "Quiet day. Nothing special. Felt peaceful." is a valid treasure. Years from now, even ordinary days will be precious.
