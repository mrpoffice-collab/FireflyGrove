# Understanding Trees and Branches

Firefly Grove uses a natural metaphor to organize memories: Trees represent people, Branches organize their stories by theme, and Memories are the fireflies that glow within.

---

## The Three Layers

### 🌳 Trees: People

Each tree represents one person in your life.

**Examples:**
- Grandma Helen
- Dad
- My childhood friend Sarah
- Uncle Robert

A tree is a container for all memories related to that person. Think of it as their dedicated space in your grove.

### 🌿 Branches: Themes

Branches organize a person's memories by category or theme.

**Examples for "Grandma Helen" tree:**
- Her Garden Wisdom
- Sunday Dinner Recipes
- Stories She Told Me
- Letters She Wrote
- Her Paintings

Branches help you find specific types of memories quickly. They're flexible — create as many or as few as you need.

### ✨ Memories: The Fireflies

Individual memories are the "fireflies" — each story, photo, voice recording, or moment you capture.

**Examples in "Her Garden Wisdom" branch:**
- Photo of her rose garden with her planting tips
- Voice recording of her explaining how to prune tomatoes
- Story about the year the squirrels ate all the tomatoes
- Her handwritten note about composting

## Why This Structure?

### Person-First Organization

Unlike chronological timelines or random albums, Firefly Grove organizes by **who**, not **when**.

This matches how we naturally remember:
- ❌ "What happened on June 12, 2019?"
- ✅ "What stories do I have about Grandma?"

### Flexible Themes

Branches let you organize however makes sense:
- **By topic**: Recipes, Wisdom, Stories, Career
- **By time**: Childhood, College Years, Retirement
- **By location**: The Farm, Beach House, Road Trips
- **By relationship**: As a Mother, As a Friend, As a Mentor

### Scalable

Start simple:
- 1 tree → 1 branch → 3 memories

Grow naturally:
- 10 trees → 30 branches → 500 memories

The structure scales without becoming overwhelming.

## Trees vs Open Grove

**Your Grove (Private Trees)**
- People you have personal connections to
- You control all memories and branches
- Private by default

**Open Grove (Shared Legacy Trees)**
- Public historical figures or shared family trees
- Community-contributed memories
- Anyone can add (with moderation)

## Tips & Best Practices

- 💡 **Start with one person you want to honor**
  Don't try to document everyone at once. Pick one meaningful person and begin there.

- 💡 **Create branches as you need them**
  Start with 1-2 broad branches. Split into more specific themes as memories accumulate.

- 💡 **Branch names should spark memory**
  Instead of "Photos," try "Beach House Summers" or "Her Sewing Room."

- 💡 **One person = one tree**
  Don't create separate trees for different life periods. Use branches instead.

- 💡 **Living trees can become legacy trees**
  When someone passes, you can convert their living tree to a legacy tree.

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I move memories between branches?**

A: Yes! Open the memory, click the menu, and select "Move to another branch."

**Q: How many branches should I create per tree?**

A: Start with 3-5 broad themes. You can always split them later as you add more memories.

**Q: Can I rename or delete branches?**

A: Yes. Open the branch settings (⚙️ icon) to rename, edit description, or delete. Deleting a branch also deletes its memories, so be careful!

**Q: What's the difference between a Living Tree and Legacy Tree?**

A: It's mainly semantic. Legacy trees are for people who have passed. Living trees are for people still with us. You can convert between them anytime.

**Q: Can I share specific branches with family?**

A: Yes! Each branch has sharing settings. You can invite family to view or contribute to specific branches.
