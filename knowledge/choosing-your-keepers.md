# Choosing Your Keepers

Your memories hold light that shouldn't fade when you're gone. Choosing keepers ensures your stories find the right hands at the right time.

---

## What Are Keepers?

Keepers (also called "heirs") are the people you designate to receive your memories after you pass. They become the guardians of your stories, ensuring the light you've captured continues to glow for generations.

Think of them as trustees of your digital legacy — the ones you trust to preserve, share, and honor your memories.

---

## Why Choose Keepers?

- 💫 **Your stories deserve keepers**
  Each memory you create is precious. Keepers ensure they're not lost when you're gone.

- 🔒 **Private until you choose to share**
  Your memories remain completely private until release conditions are met.

- 🌱 **Plan today, protect forever**
  Peace of mind knowing your legacy is secure and will reach the right people.

- ✨ **Control who gets what**
  Different branches can have different keepers. Your childhood memories might go to siblings, while stories about your own children go to them.

## How to Choose Keepers

### Step-by-Step

1. **Open Branch Settings**

   Navigate to any branch and click the settings icon (⚙️) in the top right.

2. **Go to the Heirs Tab**

   You'll see tabs at the top: Details, Sharing, **Heirs**. Click Heirs.

3. **Add a Keeper**

   Click "Add Heir" and enter their email address. You can add multiple keepers for each branch.

4. **Set Release Conditions**

   Choose when your keeper receives access:
   - **After Passing**: Access granted when you're confirmed deceased
   - **Specific Date**: Access on a predetermined date (birthdays, anniversaries)
   - **Immediate**: Access right away (for shared family archives)

5. **Add a Personal Message (Optional)**

   Write a note that your keeper will see when they receive access. Something like:

   *"These are memories of my grandmother. I hope they help you know her as I did."*

6. **Save Your Choices**

   Your keepers are now set. They won't be notified until release conditions are met.

## Tips & Best Practices

- 💡 **Start with your closest people**
  Begin with immediate family or your most trusted friends. You can always add more keepers later.

- 💡 **Different branches, different keepers**
  Your professional career branch might go to colleagues, while personal memories go to family.

- 💡 **Add backup keepers**
  Consider adding multiple keepers per branch in case your first choice can't be reached.

- 💡 **Update as life changes**
  Relationships evolve. Review your keepers every year or after major life events.

- 💡 **Explain your choices**
  Use the personal message feature to explain why you chose them and what the memories mean.

## Common Questions

A: Yes, absolutely. You can add, remove, or change keepers anytime. Your current choices aren't locked in.

**Q: Will my keepers know I've chosen them?**

A: Not unless you tell them. Keepers aren't notified until the release conditions are met. This gives you privacy to plan without obligation.

**Q: What if my keeper doesn't use Firefly Grove?**

A: They'll receive an email invitation when release conditions are met. They can create a free account to access your memories. No subscription required for heirs.

A: Yes! Each branch can have its own set of keepers. This lets you match memories with the most meaningful recipients.

**Q: What happens if I don't choose any keepers?**

A: Your memories will remain in your account, accessible only to you. They won't be deleted, but they also won't be passed on automatically.

**Q: Is there a limit to how many keepers I can have?**
