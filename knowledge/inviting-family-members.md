# Inviting Family Members

Share the tending with those who knew them best. Every perspective makes the story richer.

---

## Why Share?

Memory-keeping shouldn't be solitary work. When you invite family members to collaborate:

- 💫 **Richer stories from multiple viewpoints**
  Your sister remembers stories you forgot. Your cousin has photos you've never seen. Each person brings their unique piece of the mosaic.

- 🌿 **Share the work of preservation**
  Building a complete picture of someone's life is easier when everyone contributes what they remember.

- ✨ **Discover memories you didn't know about**
  Collaboration sparks new memories. One person's story reminds another of something long forgotten.

- 💚 **Strengthen family bonds**
  Working together to preserve memories creates meaningful connections in the present.

### Step-by-Step

1. **Open Branch Settings**

2. **Navigate to Sharing Tab**

   You'll see tabs: Details, **Sharing**, Heirs. Click Sharing.

3. **Click "Invite Someone"**

   Enter their email address. They'll need to create a Firefly Grove account if they don't have one.

4. **Choose Permission Level**

   Select what they can do:
   - **View Only**: Read memories, see photos, listen to recordings
   - **Can Add**: View + add new memories and photos
   - **Can Edit**: View + Add + edit existing memories (including ones you wrote)

5. **Add a Personal Message (Optional)**

   Include a note explaining why you're inviting them:

   *"I'm creating a collection of Grandma's stories. Would you add your memories of her too?"*

6. **Send Invitation**

   They'll receive an email with a direct link to join the branch.

## Tips & Best Practices

- 💡 **Send a personal message**
  Generic invites often get ignored. Explain why their perspective matters and what specific memories you hope they'll share.

- 💡 **Start with close family, expand later**
  Begin with 2-3 people who knew the person well. Once you've built momentum, invite others.

- 💡 **They'll get an email with a direct link**
  The invitation includes a link that takes them straight to the branch. They don't need to navigate your grove structure.

- 💡 **Set clear expectations**
  When inviting someone with "Can Edit" permission, let them know the tone and style you're aiming for.

- 💡 **Collaboration works best with active contributors**
  One person adding regularly is better than ten people who never participate. Focus on people who are genuinely interested.

## Branch-Level Sharing vs Tree-Level

**Important**: You share individual **branches**, not entire trees.

Why?
- You might want to share "Grandma's Recipes" with everyone
- But keep "Difficult Memories" private or limited to close family

Each branch can have different collaborators with different permissions.

---

## What Collaborators See

When someone accepts your invitation:
- **They see**: Only that specific branch, its memories, and who else has access
- **They don't see**: Your other trees, branches, or personal memories
- **In their grove**: The shared branch appears in a "Shared with You" section

---

## Common Questions

**Q: Can collaborators invite other people?**

A: No. Only the branch owner (you) can invite people. This prevents branches from being shared beyond your intended circle.

**Q: What if someone stops contributing? Can I remove them?**

A: Yes, absolutely. Open Branch Settings → Sharing → Remove Access. Their past contributions remain, but they can no longer access the branch.

**Q: Can I share an entire tree at once?**

A: Not directly. You need to share each branch individually. This gives you fine-grained control over who sees what.

**Q: Do collaborators need a paid subscription?**

A: No! People you invite can participate for free. They only need a paid subscription if they want to create their own trees.

**Q: What happens to their contributions if I remove them?**

A: Their memories, photos, and recordings stay in the branch. You own all content in your branches, even if others contributed it.

**Q: Can I see who wrote each memory?**

A: Yes. Each memory shows the author's name and when it was added.
