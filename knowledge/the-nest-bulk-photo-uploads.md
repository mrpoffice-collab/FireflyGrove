# The Nest: Bulk Photo Uploads

Got hundreds of photos to add? The Nest is your staging area. Upload everything at once, then "hatch" photos into memories when you're ready.

---

## What Is The Nest?

The Nest is a temporary holding space for photos before you attach them to specific memories. Think of it like a lightbox or staging area.

**The workflow:**
1. **Upload** → Dump all your photos into the Nest
2. **Review** → Browse them in a grid, see what you have
3. **Hatch** → Move photos to specific branches/memories
4. **Clean up** → Delete duplicates or photos you don't need

It's especially useful when you:
- Have old photo albums to digitize
- Inherit a USB drive of family photos
- Found a box of prints in the attic
- Want to bulk upload from your phone

## Why Use The Nest?

### Without The Nest:
- Upload one photo at a time to each memory
- Create memories just to attach photos
- Get overwhelmed deciding where everything goes
- Give up halfway through

### With The Nest:
- 💫 **Upload everything at once**
  Drag and drop 500 photos. Get them into the system first, organize later.

- 🌿 **Review before committing**
  Browse all photos, delete duplicates, decide what's worth keeping.

- ✨ **Hatch into memories gradually**
  Turn photos into full memories when inspiration strikes. No pressure to do it all at once.

- 🔒 **Private staging area**
  Photos in the Nest are only visible to you until you hatch them.

## How to Use The Nest

### Uploading Photos

1. **Go to The Nest**

   Click "The Nest" in your grove header or navigate to `/nest`.

2. **Upload Photos**

   - **Drag and drop** files into the upload area
   - Or **click to browse** and select multiple files
   - Or **paste** images from your clipboard

   You can upload:
   - JPG, PNG, HEIC (iPhone photos)
   - Multiple photos at once (up to 50 per batch)
   - Photos from your computer, phone, or tablet

3. **Wait for Upload**

   Photos upload in the background. You'll see progress indicators. Once uploaded, they appear in your Nest grid.

### Hatching Photos into Memories

**Method 1: Hatch from Nest**

1. Open The Nest (`/nest`)
2. Select one or more photos (checkbox in corner)
3. Click "Hatch from Nest" button
4. Choose the tree and branch
5. Choose how to hatch:
   - **Create new memory for each photo**
   - **Add all photos to one existing memory**
   - **Create one new memory with all photos**

**Method 2: Hatch from Branch**

1. Open a branch
2. Click "Add Memory" or edit an existing memory
3. Click "Add from Nest"
4. Select photos from your Nest
5. Photos are automatically removed from Nest after hatching

---

### Organizing Your Nest

**Sort Options:**
- By upload date (newest/oldest first)
- By file size
- By filename

**Filter Options:**
- Recently uploaded (last 7 days)
- Older items (7+ days)
- Large files (for review)

**Bulk Actions:**
- Select multiple photos
- Delete in batch
- Hatch multiple at once

---

## The Hatching Process

When you "hatch" a photo:

1. **Photo moves from Nest → Branch**
2. **Nest copy is deleted** (to avoid duplicates)
3. **Photo becomes part of a memory**
4. **Permanent storage in Firefly Grove**

You can't un-hatch. Once it's part of a memory, removing the photo means deleting it from that memory.

## Tips & Best Practices

- 💡 **Upload first, organize later**
  Don't try to organize during upload. Get everything into the Nest, then take your time deciding what goes where.

- 💡 **Review before hatching**
  Delete blurry photos, duplicates, or accidental screenshots before they become memories.

- 💡 **Use descriptive memory titles when hatching**
  "Grandma's Garden 1995" is better than "Photo Album 3."

- 💡 **Clean out your Nest monthly**
  Photos sitting in the Nest for months probably don't need to be memories. Delete or hatch them.

- 💡 **The Nest isn't permanent storage**
  Photos in the Nest can be deleted by you anytime. Only hatched photos are permanent.

## Nest vs Direct Upload

**Use The Nest when:**
- You have many photos to upload at once
- You're not sure where photos belong yet
- You want to review quality before committing
- You're digitizing old albums

**Upload directly to a memory when:**
- You have 1-3 photos
- You know exactly which memory they belong to
- You're adding photos while writing a memory

Both methods work. The Nest just adds a staging step for bulk operations.

## Common Questions

**Q: How long do photos stay in the Nest?**

A: Forever, until you hatch or delete them. There's no automatic cleanup. We recommend reviewing your Nest monthly.

**Q: Does the Nest count against my storage limit?**

A: Yes. Photos in the Nest count toward your plan's storage limit, just like memories.

**Q: Can I download all photos from my Nest?**

A: Not currently, but you can download individual photos. Use your Forever Kit export if you need a full backup.

**Q: What happens if I delete a photo from the Nest accidentally?**

A: It's permanently deleted. The Nest doesn't have a trash/recycle bin. Be careful with bulk delete.

**Q: Can others see my Nest photos?**

A: No. The Nest is completely private. Only you can see photos there until you hatch them into shared branches.

**Q: Can I edit photos before hatching?**

A: Not within Firefly Grove. Edit photos on your device before uploading, or after hatching them into memories.

**Q: What file size is too large?**

A: Maximum file size is 20MB per photo. Most phone photos are 2-5MB, which is perfect. If you have large RAW files, export them as JPG first.
