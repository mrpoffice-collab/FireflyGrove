## üéØ Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Set Up API Credentials (35 min)
- [ ] **Resend** (5 min) - Easiest first
- [ ] **Pinterest** (10 min)
- [ ] **Facebook** (20 min)
- [ ] Generate **CRON_SECRET**

### 2. Test Locally (10 min)
- [ ] Add credentials to `.env.local`
- [ ] Generate 1 topic ‚Üí batch generate
- [ ] Approve 1 post from each platform in drafts
- [ ] Manually trigger cron:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/cron/publish-scheduled \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
  ```
- [ ] Verify posts appear on each platform

### 3. Deploy to Production (10 min)
- [ ] Add all env vars to Vercel
- [ ] Create `vercel.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "crons": [{
      "path": "/api/cron/publish-scheduled",
      "schedule": "0 9 * * *"
    }]
  }
  ```
- [ ] Commit and push
- [ ] Redeploy on Vercel
- [ ] Verify cron job is active

### 4. Generate 3-Month Content Plan (2 hours)
- [ ] Generate 39 topics (3 posts/week √ó 13 weeks)
- [ ] Batch generate all content
- [ ] Review and approve posts over a few days
- [ ] System auto-publishes on schedule

**Total Time to Full Automation: ~1 hour**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Configuration

**Topic Generation Settings:**
- Model: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
- Min confidence: 65% (adjustable)
- Scoring: Relevance (40%) + Competition (35%) + Demand (25%)
- Smart filter: Hides drafted/published/dismissed topics

**Content Generation:**
- Blog length: ~2000 words
- Uses BRAND.md for voice
- Uses COMPASS.md for mission
- SEO-optimized (keywords, meta description, slug)
- Markdown format with YAML frontmatter

**Publishing Schedule:**
- Cron runs: Daily at 9:00 AM UTC
- Blog posts: Scheduled on specific dates (user-defined intervals)
- Social posts: Scheduled 1 day after blog
- Only publishes approved posts
- Failed posts marked with error details

## üîç Important Decisions Made

### Reddit Removal
**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Reason:** Ethical boundary - Reddit automation required deceptive engagement (pretending to have personal problems to get traction). This crosses the line from storytelling to deception.

**Decision:** Remove Reddit entirely from automation. Users can manually post to Reddit if they choose to engage authentically.

### Brief Generation Button Removal
**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Reason:** Confusing UX - users thought generating a brief = generating content.
**Solution:** Removed button. Briefs now auto-generate during batch content generation.

### Smart Filtering
**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Behavior:** Topics with `status = 'drafted'` now show by default (not hidden). This allows users to select drafted topics and generate content from existing briefs. Only `published` and `dismissed` topics are hidden.

---

## üìä Testing Results

**Topic Generation (20 topics):**
- ‚úÖ Generated 299 raw topics
- ‚úÖ Scored all with AI
- ‚úÖ 20 passed 65% confidence threshold
- ‚úÖ Topics correctly filtered by status
- ‚úÖ Smart filter working (360-day check)

**Content Generation (1 topic):**
- ‚úÖ Brief auto-generated
- ‚úÖ Blog post written (2000+ words)
- ‚úÖ Content repurposed to all platforms
- ‚úÖ Drafts saved correctly
- ‚úÖ Scheduling dates applied
- ‚è≥ Publishing NOT tested yet (need API credentials)

**Approval Workflow:**

---

## üêõ Known Issues

**None currently.** System is stable and ready for API integration.

---

## üí° Future Enhancements (Not Critical)

- [ ] Staggered cron jobs (post at optimal times per platform)
- [ ] Image generation for Pinterest pins
- [ ] Analytics dashboard (views, signups per post)
- [ ] A/B testing for headlines
- [ ] Retry failed posts automatically
- [ ] Email editor (rich text vs plain)
- [ ] Schedule manual override (pause/reschedule posts)

---

## üìû Quick Reference

**Check what's scheduled:**
```bash
GET /api/cron/publish-scheduled
```

**Manually trigger publishing:**
```bash
POST /api/cron/publish-scheduled
Header: Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET
```

**View topic briefs:**
- After batch generation, click "üìÑ View Brief" on drafted topics

**Hide topics:**
- Click "‚úï Hide" to dismiss (won't show up again)

**Prisma Studio:**
```bash
npx prisma studio
# Open http://localhost:5555
# View: TopicScore, ContentBrief, MarketingPost tables
```

---

## üéì For Future Reference

**The system works like this:**

1. **AI generates topic ideas** using your brand voice
2. **Scores them** for ranking potential (demand, competition, relevance)
3. **Filters out losers** (below confidence threshold)
4. **You select winners** (checkbox selection)
5. **AI writes everything** (blog + repurposed social content)
6. **You approve** what you like (draft review page)
7. **Cron auto-publishes** on schedule (no manual work)
8. **Content lives forever** (markdown files for blog, posts on platforms)

**Key principle:** Approve once, publish automatically. Zero daily manual work.

---

**STATUS: Ready for API credentials! üöÄ**

Once you add the environment variables and deploy, the entire system will be fully automated.
