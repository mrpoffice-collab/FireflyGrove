**Reddit Power Strategy:**
Post your own content ONLY after building karma:

**"Show Reddit" Post Template:**
```
Title: "I built a tool to turn my grandmother's voice into wall art"

Hey r/[subreddit],

After my grandmother passed, I wanted to preserve her voice. So I built a tool that turns audio into sound wave art.

You can upload a voice memo and get printable wall art in minutes.

I added it to my family memory app (Firefly Grove). It's free to use.

[Screenshot of sound wave art]

Would love feedback!

[Link if allowed, or "DM for link"]
```

**Follow 9:1 Rule:**
- 9 helpful comments for every 1 promotional post
- Build karma first

**Facebook Group Strategy:**
Post valuable content that subtly links back:

**Example Post:**
```
Has anyone else struggled with preserving family recordings?

I just found out you can turn voice memos into sound wave art. Thinking about making one with my dad's laugh.

Anyone done this before? Looking for tips!
