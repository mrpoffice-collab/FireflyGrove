## Sponsorship Economics & Pricing

### Industry Standard Pricing

**YouTube CPM Model**:
- **CPM** = Cost Per Mille (thousand views)

- 10,000 views × $25 CPM = $250
- 50,000 views × $30 CPM = $1,500
- 100,000 views × $20 CPM = $2,000

**Micro (5k-20k subs)**:
- **Cost**: $100-400/video
- **Views**: 1k-10k
- **Best For**: Testing, niche targeting

## Sponsorship Content Guidelines

### What to Provide Creators

**Standard Package**:
1. **Talking Points** (not script - let them be authentic)
2. **Promo Code** (unique to their channel)
3. **Landing Page Link** (with UTM parameters)
4. **Product Screenshots/Demo** (optional, if they want to show it)
5. **Brand Assets** (logo, colors if needed)

### Sample Talking Points

**Version 1: Emotional Story Angle** (30-45 seconds)
```
"Before we dive in, I want to tell you about something that's
really helped me with my own family history.

This video is sponsored by Firefly Grove - and honestly, I wish
I'd had this tool when my grandmother passed away. There were
so many stories I never recorded, so many questions I never asked.

Firefly Grove helps you capture family stories, organize memories,
and create a digital legacy before it's too late. You can record
voice memories, upload photos, and even plan what happens to it
all when you're gone.

If you've been putting off preserving your family's history -
and trust me, most of us are - check out FireflyGrove.app.

Use code [YOURCODE] for 20% off. Link's in the description."
```

**Version 2: Problem-Solution Angle** (30-45 seconds)
```
"Quick sponsor message - this one's actually really relevant to
what we're talking about today.

If you're like me, you've got boxes of old family photos, maybe
some audio recordings, letters from grandparents - all scattered
everywhere. And you keep meaning to organize it, but... life.

Firefly Grove is a platform that helps you finally get it all
in one place. You can upload photos, record family stories, even
interview older relatives with prompts. And the best part - you
can decide who gets access to everything when you're gone.

It's basically what I wish existed when I was going through my
parents' attic. Check it out at FireflyGrove.app - code [YOURCODE]
gets you 20% off."
```

**Version 3: Practical Benefit Angle** (30-45 seconds)
```
"Today's video is sponsored by Firefly Grove, and I think you'll
actually find this useful.

How many of you have family stories that exist only in your
memory? Or in one aging relative's memory? That's the problem
Firefly Grove solves.

It's a digital platform where you can record stories, organize
photos, and create what they call a "memory grove" for your family.
Think of it like a private family archive that won't get lost in
someone's basement.

What I really like is you can interview family members using their
prompt system - so even if you don't know what to ask, they guide
you through it.

If preserving your family history is on your someday list, make it
today. FireflyGrove.app - use code [YOURCODE] for 20% off."

```

**In Your Database**:
```sql
-- Add to User model
signupSource: String? // "GENEALOGYTV20"
referredBy: String? // "youtube_genealogytv"

-- Track conversions
CREATE TABLE sponsorship_conversions (
  id: String
  promoCode: String
  creatorChannel: String
  userId: String
  signupDate: DateTime
  subscriptionValue: Decimal
)
```

### UTM Parameters

**URL Structure**:
```
https://fireflygrove.app?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=genealogytv
```

**Track in Analytics**:

```
YouTube View
  ↓
Click Link (CTR: 1-3%)
  ↓
Land on Site (Bounce: 40-60%)
  ↓
Sign Up (Conversion: 5-15%)
```

### ROI Calculation

**Formula**:
```
ROI = (Signups × LTV - Sponsorship Cost) / Sponsorship Cost × 100

Example:
- Sponsorship Cost: $500
- Signups: 50
- LTV: $30
- Revenue: 50 × $30 = $1,500
- ROI: ($1,500 - $500) / $500 × 100 = 200%
```

**Break-Even Analysis**:
```
Break-Even Signups = Sponsorship Cost / LTV

Example:
- Cost: $500
- LTV: $30
- Break-Even: $500 / $30 = 17 signups

Anything above 17 signups = profitable
```

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Wrong Audience Targeting
**Problem**: Sponsoring channels with wrong demographic
**Solution**:
- Watch 3-5 videos before committing
- Check comment section for age indicators
- Ask creator for audience demographics

### Pitfall 2: Unrealistic Expectations

- Test with $500-1,000 first
- Give it 3-5 sponsorships to see patterns

### Pitfall 3: Poor Promo Code Tracking
**Problem**: Can't tell which channel drove signups
**Solution**:
- Unique code per creator

**Solution**:
- Follow up after video goes live
- Share performance metrics
- Offer ongoing partnership if successful

### Pitfall 5: Over-Scripting Content
**Problem**: Forcing creators to read exact script
**Solution**:
- Provide talking points, not script
- Let them be authentic
- Better conversion with genuine endorsement

### Pitfall 6: Ignoring Smaller Channels
**Problem**: Only targeting 100k+ channels
**Solution**:
- Micro-influencers (5k-20k) often better ROI
- More affordable testing
- More willing to negotiate

### Pitfall 7: No Contract/Agreement
**Problem**: Unclear deliverables, payment disputes
**Solution**:
- Simple 1-page agreement
- Specify: deliverables, timeline, payment
- Both parties sign before payment
