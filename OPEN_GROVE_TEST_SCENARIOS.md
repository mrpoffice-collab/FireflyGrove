# Open Grove Test Scenarios

## Overview
Complete test setup for the **Open Grove** system - the public legacy tree system where deceased individuals' memories are preserved temporarily (100 memory limit, 60-day trustee period) before being adopted into private groves for unlimited storage.

- Trees can be discovered and adopted by family members
- After adoption ‚Üí moves to private grove ‚Üí **unlimited memories**

**Key Architecture:**
- System user: `system@fireflygrove.com`
- Grove status: `LOCKED` (can't login)
- Plan type: `institutional`
- Tree limit: 999,999 (effectively unlimited trees)

## üìä DATABASE VERIFICATION

After testing, verify in Prisma Studio or SQL:

```sql
-- Check Open Grove trees
SELECT
  p.name,
  p.memoryCount,
  p.memoryLimit,
  p.isLegacy,
  p.trusteeExpiresAt,
  u.email as owner_email
FROM "Person" p
JOIN "User" u ON p.ownerId = u.id
JOIN "GroveTreeMembership" gtm ON p.id = gtm.personId
JOIN "Grove" g ON gtm.groveId = g.id
WHERE g.isOpenGrove = true
ORDER BY p.name;

-- Check private adopted trees
SELECT
  p.name,
  p.memoryCount,
  p.memoryLimit,
  p.trusteeExpiresAt,
  u.email as owner_email,
  g.name as grove_name
FROM "Person" p
JOIN "User" u ON p.ownerId = u.id
JOIN "GroveTreeMembership" gtm ON p.id = gtm.personId
JOIN "Grove" g ON gtm.groveId = g.id
WHERE g.isOpenGrove = false AND p.isLegacy = true
ORDER BY p.name;

-- Check memory counts match entries
SELECT
  p.name,
  p.memoryCount as counted,
  COUNT(e.id) as actual
FROM "Person" p
LEFT JOIN "Branch" b ON p.id = b.personId
LEFT JOIN "Entry" e ON b.id = e.branchId
GROUP BY p.id, p.name, p.memoryCount
HAVING p.memoryCount != COUNT(e.id);

-- Check for trees at limit
SELECT
  p.name,
  p.memoryCount,
  p.memoryLimit,
  CASE
    WHEN p.memoryLimit IS NOT NULL AND p.memoryCount >= p.memoryLimit
    THEN 'AT LIMIT'
    ELSE 'OK'
  END as status
FROM "Person" p
WHERE p.isLegacy = true
ORDER BY p.memoryCount DESC;
```

---

## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES TO WATCH FOR

1. **Memory limit not enforced:** Check if API validates against `memoryLimit` field
2. **Counter not updating:** Verify `memoryCount` increments on entry creation
3. **Adoption fails silently:** Ensure transaction completes fully or rolls back
4. **Trustee expiration ignored:** Check if UI shows warnings
5. **Search/discovery broken:** Verify `discoveryEnabled` flag is checked
6. **Tree appears in both groves:** Check GroveTreeMembership after adoption
7. **Unlimited after adoption not working:** Verify `memoryLimit` set to NULL

---

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA

Open Grove system is working correctly if:

- ‚úÖ Trees in Open Grove have 100 memory limit
- ‚úÖ Trees in Open Grove have 60-day trustee period
- ‚úÖ Clear error when trying to add 101st memory
- ‚úÖ Adoption moves tree to private grove
- ‚úÖ Memory limit removed after adoption (NULL)

---

## üöÄ HOW TO RECREATE

If you need to reset and recreate these scenarios:

```bash
# Run the Open Grove setup script
npx tsx scripts/setup-open-grove-test.ts
```

This will:
1. Initialize Open Grove (system grove)
2. Create adopter user
3. Create 5 legacy trees in Open Grove with different scenarios
4. Create 1 already-adopted tree in private grove
5. Set up memory limit testing (100 limit)
6. Set up trustee expiration scenarios
7. Populate with realistic memory data

**Note:** Run `scripts/seed-beta-tester.ts` first if beta tester account doesn't exist.

## üìù DETAILED TEST SCENARIOS

### Scenario A: Memory Limit Testing

**Objective:** Verify 100 memory limit in Open Grove and unlimited after adoption

**Steps:**
1. Log in as beta@fireflygrove.app
2. Select Jane Smith tree (100/100)
3. Try to add memory ‚Üí Should fail
4. Note error message
5. Adopt Jane Smith into private grove
6. Try to add memory again ‚Üí Should succeed
7. Add 50 more memories (150 total)
8. Verify all display correctly

**Expected Results:**
- Error at 101 in Open Grove: Clear message with adoption suggestion
- After adoption: No limit, counter shows 150+
- UI shows "Unlimited" instead of "X/100"

---

### Scenario B: Trustee Expiration

**Objective:** Test expiration warnings and grace period

**Steps:**
1. Log in as beta@fireflygrove.app
2. View Robert Johnson tree (expired 10 days ago)
3. Note warning banner

5. Try to adopt expired tree
6. Verify adoption succeeds

**Expected Results:**
- Clear warning: "Trustee period expired 10 days ago"
